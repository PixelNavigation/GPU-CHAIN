### 💰 Next Step: Get Testnet Funds

Before deploying, you need testnet ETH. Visit these faucets:

#### Sepolia Testnet (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
2. Enter your address: `0xce5920909A50d3557c6DF5B3978c541088Bc4DBC`
3. Request testnet ETH (usually 0.5 ETH)

#### Alternative Sepolia Faucets
- https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
- https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia

#### Polygon Mumbai (Cheaper for testing)
1. Go to: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
2. Enter your address: `0xce5920909A50d3557c6DF5B3978c541088Bc4DBC`
3. Select "Mumbai" network
4. Request MATIC tokens

### 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

Once you have testnet funds:

```bash
# Check your balance
npx hardhat run scripts/check-wallet.js --network sepolia

# Deploy to Sepolia
npm run deploy:sepolia

# Or deploy to Mumbai (cheaper)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

### 🔒 Security Reminders

- ✅ Private key is properly configured
- ✅ Using development wallet (not your main wallet)
- ⚠️ **NEVER** use this private key for mainnet
- ⚠️ **NEVER** commit `.env` file to version control
- ✅ Only use testnet funds

### 🎯 Deployment Commands Ready

```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm run test

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia

# Verify contract (after deployment)
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address> npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network sepolia
```

### 📱 Frontend Integration

After deployment:
1. Contract address will be automatically saved to `client/src/utils/contract-config.json`
2. Your frontend will automatically use the new deployed contract
3. ABI is already updated in `client/src/utils/ComputeReward-abi.json`
