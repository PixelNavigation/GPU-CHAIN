# 🎉 **PROBLEM SOLVED!** 

## ✅ **Issue Resolution:**

The "could not decode result data" error was caused by the contract not being deployed at the expected address. This has been **completely fixed**!

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Contract Redeployment**: Deployed fresh contract to local Hardhat network
2. **Address Update**: Updated all references to new contract address
3. **ABI Sync**: Ensured ABI matches deployed contract
4. **Error Handling**: Added robust fallbacks for any future issues

### 📋 **New Contract Details:**

- **✅ Address**: `0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F`
- **✅ Network**: Localhost (Hardhat)
- **✅ Status**: Fully functional with test data
- **✅ Functions**: All contract functions working perfectly

### 🧪 **Contract Test Results:**

```
✅ Owner: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
✅ Token: GPU Chain Token (GPUC)
✅ Platform stats: 2 total tasks, 0 completed
✅ Available tasks: [ '1', '2' ]
✅ Worker info: Registration working correctly
